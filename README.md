# LabKeeper

**Cross-platform Flutter app for managing lab equipment borrowing, backed by Firebase.**

---

## üìñ Overview

LabKeeper lets students request, track, and return lab equipment via a polished mobile interface, while administrators review, approve, and audit those requests. Behind the scenes, Firebase Authentication secures access, Cloud Firestore stores all data, Cloud Functions power reactive notifications, and FCM delivers real-time push alerts. A proximity check‚Äîusing device GPS and a short-lived presence feed‚Äîensures handoffs occur only when borrower and approver are co-located.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Setup & Installation

1. **Clone the repo**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/<your-org>/labkeeper.git
   cd labkeeper
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**

   ```bash
   flutter pub get
   ```

3. **Firebase Configuration**

   * In the Firebase console, enable **Authentication**, **Firestore**, **Storage**, and **Cloud Functions**.
   * Create Firestore indexes for `borrow_requests` on `status` and `returnDate`.
   * Download and place `google-services.json` (Android) and `GoogleService-Info.plist` (iOS) under `android/app/` and `ios/Runner/` respectively.
   * Deploy Cloud Functions:

     ```bash
     cd functions
     npm install
     firebase deploy --only functions
     ```

4. **Android Setup**

   * Ensure min SDK ‚â• 21 in `android/app/build.gradle`.
   * Add the required permissions in `AndroidManifest.xml` for Internet, camera, location, and notifications.

5. **iOS Setup**

   * Enable Push Notifications and Background Modes (Remote notifications) in Xcode.
   * Add required Info.plist entries for camera, photo library, and location usage.

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Running the App

* **On Android**

  ```bash
  flutter run -d android
  ```
* **On iOS**

  ```bash
  flutter run -d ios
  ```

## üîß Testing Notifications

1. **Foreground**: Triggers via `FirebaseMessaging.onMessage` and displays a local notification.
2. **Background/Terminated**:

   * Send an FCM with both `notification` and `data` payload from Cloud Functions.
   * The background handler (`onBackgroundMessage`) will surface a local notification so it‚Äôs fully expanded.
3. **Tap Handling**:

   * All notifications carry `requestId` in `data`.
   * On tap, deep-link logic in your `navigatorKey` pushes the correct detail screen after splash or from any app state.
